## Points from the group discussion
1) It is good to limit the number of dependencies because the dependencies increase the size of our package. Also, a high number of dependencies increases a chance that they will include a function with a same name, which might cause some unexpected behaviour, although this issue can be avoided by specifying the package from which the function comes.
